# Installation

## For Humans

Paste this into your LLM agent (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.):

```
Install and configure Arkloop by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arkloop/arkloop/main/docs/installation.md
```

Or read the [installation guide](./installation.md), but seriously, let an agent do it.

You are helping a user install Arkloop, a self-hosted conversational AI agent platform. Follow these steps in order.

### Step 0: Detect Host Environment

Run the doctor command first. Parse the output to inform later decisions.

```bash
./setup.sh doctor
```

Expected output fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `platform=linux\|macos\|wsl2` | Host OS |
| `docker=1\|0` | Docker daemon reachable |
| `compose=1\|0` | `docker compose` plugin available |
| `docker_socket=<path>\|not-found` | Accessible Docker socket path |
| `kvm=1\|0` | KVM device present (Linux only) |
| `port_8000=free\|in-use` | Default gateway port availability |
| `port_9000=free\|in-use` | MinIO port availability |

If `docker=0` or `compose=0`, **stop here** and follow the [Docker prerequisite guide](#docker-not-available).

If this is a fresh checkout and `setup.sh` isn't executable yet:

```bash
chmod +x ./setup.sh
```

### Step 1: Ask the User 8 Questions

Ask these questions to determine installation parameters. Keep them in this order. Do not expose internal implementation details (compose profiles, port numbers, Redis database numbers) as options.

---

**Q1 — Deployment profile**

> Do you want the standard self-hosted install, or a full install with all optional modules?

- Standard (recommended): core stack + gateway + console → `--profile standard`
- Full: standard + memory system + code execution + browser → `--profile full`

**Default: standard**

---

**Q2 — Memory system**

> Do you want to enable a persistent memory system for agents (OpenViking)?

- No: agents have no cross-session memory → `--memory none`
- Yes: install and connect OpenViking → `--memory openviking`

**Default: none**

---

**Q3 — Code execution sandbox**

> Do you want agents to be able to execute code in an isolated environment?

- No: disable code execution → `--sandbox none`
- Yes: enable sandbox (auto-detect below) → `--sandbox docker` or `--sandbox firecracker`

**Default: none**

If the user answers Yes, proceed to **Q3a** before continuing.

**Q3a — Sandbox backend (auto-detect, ask only if Q3 = yes)**

Check doctor output:

- `platform=linux` AND `kvm=1` → recommend Firecracker (`--sandbox firecracker`)
- Otherwise → Docker sandbox only (`--sandbox docker`)

Tell the user which backend will be used. Only ask for confirmation if the recommendation differs from their expectation.

---

**Q4 — Web search and scraping**

> Do you want agents to use web search and content scraping?
>
> - **Builtin** (recommended): uses third-party APIs (Tavily + Firecrawl/Jina). Zero infrastructure overhead, but requires API keys and has per-call cost.
> - **Self-hosted**: installs SearXNG + Firecrawl locally. No API costs, but adds resource usage and exposes a crawler from your IP.

- Builtin → `--web-tools builtin`
- Self-hosted → `--web-tools self-hosted`

**Default: builtin**

---

**Q5 — Console tier**

> Do you want the standard Console (recommended) or the full advanced Console?
>
> The full Console includes additional management pages for billing, RBAC, and system configuration. It requires more resources.

- Standard (Console Lite) → `--console lite`
- Full → `--console full`

**Default: lite**

---

**Q6 — Browser module**

> Do you want to enable the browser automation module? (Requires code execution sandbox to be enabled.)

Only ask this if Q3 = yes (sandbox enabled). If sandbox is disabled, set `--browser off` automatically.

- No → `--browser off`
- Yes → `--browser on`

**Default: off**

---

**Q7 — Gateway**

The gateway is the entry point for all traffic. For standard self-hosted installs it should always be enabled.

Set `--gateway on` unless the user explicitly says they want to run the API directly without a gateway.

**Default: on**

---

**Q8 — Deployment mode**

> Are you deploying this for personal or team use (self-hosted), or is this an Arkloop SaaS deployment?

- Self-hosted → `--mode self-hosted`
- SaaS → `--mode saas` (not supported in current release; defer if selected)

**Default: self-hosted**

> **Note**: `--mode saas` is not yet implemented. If the user selects SaaS mode, inform them it is not available in the current release and proceed with `--mode self-hosted`.

---

### Step 2: Run the Installer

Construct the install command from the answers above and run it. Always include `--non-interactive`.

```bash
./setup.sh install \
  --profile <standard|full> \
  --mode self-hosted \
  --memory <none|openviking> \
  --sandbox <none|docker|firecracker> \
  --console <lite|full> \
  --browser <off|on> \
  --web-tools <builtin|self-hosted> \
  --gateway <on|off> \
  --non-interactive
```

**Examples:**

Minimal install, no optional modules:

```bash
./setup.sh install \
  --profile standard \
  --mode self-hosted \
  --memory none \
  --sandbox none \
  --console lite \
  --browser off \
  --web-tools builtin \
  --gateway on \
  --non-interactive
```

Full install with memory, Docker sandbox, and self-hosted search:

```bash
./setup.sh install \
  --profile full \
  --mode self-hosted \
  --memory openviking \
  --sandbox docker \
  --console lite \
  --browser off \
  --web-tools self-hosted \
  --gateway on \
  --non-interactive
```

Full install with Firecracker (Linux with KVM):

```bash
./setup.sh install \
  --profile full \
  --mode self-hosted \
  --memory openviking \
  --sandbox firecracker \
  --console lite \
  --browser on \
  --web-tools builtin \
  --gateway on \
  --non-interactive
```

The installer will:

1. Check host prerequisites (Docker, Compose, KVM if needed, port availability)
2. Generate missing secrets and populate `.env`
3. Start core services, then start the gateway
4. Wait for health checks to pass
5. Print the admin initialization URL

### Step 3: Verify Installation

After the installer completes, verify the stack is running:

```bash
./setup.sh status
```

Check the gateway is reachable:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:8000/healthz && echo "gateway ok"
```

If gateway is healthy, Arkloop is running. The Console is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Step 4: Complete Admin Initialization

The installer prints a one-time bootstrap URL at the end:

```
管理员初始化地址：http://localhost:8000/bootstrap/<token>
```

Open this URL in a browser (or instruct the user to open it). The user will set their admin username and password. The token is single-use and expires after 30 minutes.

If the URL was not printed (gateway was off, or bootstrap already completed), skip this step.

## Error Handling

### Docker Not Available

Symptom: `docker=0` or `compose=0` in doctor output, or installer fails with `Docker 不可用`.

**Linux:**

```bash
# Install Docker Engine
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Re-login or run: newgrp docker
```

**macOS:** Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and start it.

**Windows (WSL2):** Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with WSL2 backend enabled.

After Docker is available, re-run `./setup.sh doctor` to confirm, then retry the installer.

---

### Docker Socket Not Found (sandbox=docker)

Symptom: `docker_socket=not-found` in doctor output, or installer fails with `未找到用户态 Docker socket`.

The sandbox requires a user-accessible Docker socket. On Linux, this is usually `/var/run/docker.sock`. Ensure the current user is in the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
docker info  # should succeed without sudo
```

---

### Firecracker Not Available

Symptom: installer fails with `firecracker 仅支持 Linux` or `当前宿主未检测到 KVM`.

Firecracker requires:
- A Linux host (not macOS, not WSL2)
- KVM support (`/dev/kvm` must exist)

If running in a VM, enable nested virtualization. If running on macOS or WSL2, use `--sandbox docker` instead.

---

### Port Already in Use

Symptom: installer fails with `端口 8000 已被占用` (or similar).

Find what is using the port:

```bash
lsof -i :8000
```

Options:
- Stop the conflicting process
- Change the Arkloop gateway port: set `ARKLOOP_GATEWAY_PORT=<port>` in `.env` before re-running the installer

---

### Pre-flight Failure Summary

If `./setup.sh install` exits with `pre-flight 检测未通过`, the output will list individual warnings. Address each one listed, then re-run the installer. The installer is idempotent — re-running it on an already-partially-installed stack is safe.

---

### Health Check Timeout

Symptom: installer exits with `服务健康检查超时`.

Check what is failing:

```bash
./setup.sh status
docker compose logs --tail=50
```

Common causes: insufficient memory (minimum 2 GB free RAM), port conflicts discovered after startup, or missing required environment variables. Fix the underlying issue, then re-run the installer.

---

### Already Installed

If Arkloop is already running, `./setup.sh install` is safe to re-run — it will not reset secrets or recreate containers unless the profile changes.

To check current installation state:

```bash
./setup.sh status
```
